# FOSS-RCX-ROM
An open source implementation of the Lego MindStorms RCX ROM,
which has been extracted from the larger
[brickEmu project](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickEmu).

These same source files have also been added to the
[brickOS-bibo project](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickOS-bibo)
as "rom" targets in the Makefiles.

Given the nature of this project, this source code is likely to
see little change, but the master version of this source code
is currently considered to be the copies in the aforementioned
[brickOS-bibo project](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickOS-bibo).
