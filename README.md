# FOSS-RCX-ROM
An open source implementation of the Lego MindStorms RCX ROM,
which has been extracted from the larger
[brickEmu project](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickEmu).

This project is designed to be able to be built either independently
or together withn brickOS-bibo when included as a git subtree in the
[brickOS-bibo project](https://github.com/BrickBot/brickOS-bibo)
as "rom" targets in the Makefiles.

Given the nature of this project, this source code is likely to
see little change.
